## Heyy👋🏻, I'm Vighnesh Maripeddi  
### Aspiring Data Analyst | BSc IT Student | Beginner in Machine Learning  

I’m a final-year BSc IT student passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights and helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
I enjoy working with Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python, and I’m actively building my skills in Machine Learning and advanced analytics.

I believe in learning by doing, so I constantly work on dashboards, analytics projects, and small ML experiments to sharpen my skills.

I’m currently improving my skills in Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, and I prefer learning by doing end-to-end projects — from data cleaning to visualization.

My work includes projects like an HR Analytics Dashboard and a Customer Behavior Analysis (Python + SQL + Power BI).
I aim to continue building more real data projects to deepen my understanding of analytics and data-driven decision making.
