## Heyy👋🏻, I'm Vighnesh Maripeddi  
### Aspiring Data Analyst | BSc IT Student | Beginner in Machine Learning  

I’m a BSc IT student focused on becoming a strong Data Analyst by learning through real-world datasets and practical projects.
I enjoy cleaning data, exploring patterns, analyzing business problems, and building dashboards that convert raw data into clear insights.

I’m currently improving my skills in Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, and I prefer learning by doing end-to-end projects — from data cleaning to visualization.

My work includes projects like an HR Analytics Dashboard and a Customer Behavior Analysis (Python + SQL + Power BI).
I aim to continue building more real data projects to deepen my understanding of analytics and data-driven decision making.
